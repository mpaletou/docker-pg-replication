# Docker PostgreSQL master/slave replication

This project's goal is to provide an easy way to deploy PostgreSQL 10+ (12.8 by default)  database with master/slave replication using minimal configuration

# Credits

This project is inspired by [2hamed docker-pg-replication repository](https://github.com/2hamed/docker-pg-replication) which made a great base for this project.

Unfortunately, it doesn't support versions greater than PostgreSQL 9.6 and is no longer maintained
